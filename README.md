## cache-keepalive

When Claude ends a turn while background tasks are still running, the prompt cache can expire before the task's notification arrives. The next request then re-writes the whole context into the cache at 2× the input price.

This mod pings the cache with a one-line fork of the conversation every 50 minutes while the session waits. A cache read costs 0.025–0.1× input, so a ping costs a few percent of a re-write. Pings stop when:

- a new turn starts
- the session ends, or `/clear` or `/resume` replaces it
- a ping misses the cache
- the pings have cost as much as one re-write would have

`/keepalive` pings now and reports the hit rate, what the ping cost, and while a wait is armed, what the wait has spent. It refuses when no wait is armed or the cache has expired, because a miss there re-writes the whole context. `/keepalive force` pings anyway. A manual ping leaves any wait as it is. The status line shows `armed`, `warm` or `stopped`. `armed` and `warm` end with the time the cache expires if no ping lands, so a line still on screen after that time is stale.

### Limitations

The mod assumes the 1h cache TTL. It cannot read the TTL, so it infers the 5m TTL from overage, which switches a session to it. It does not arm while the 5-hour or 7-day rate-limit window is at 100% or more, and it stops if one crosses 100% during the wait. Mods cannot see model-scoped limits such as Fable's weekly one, so the mod ignores them. When such a limit runs out, the first ping misses and the mod stops. Rate-limit readings arrive with this session's own responses, so the mod may not see overage that other sessions cause during a wait. When a 5m TTL slips past the check, the first ping misses, pays for a full re-cache itself and saves nothing, and the mod stops.

### Compact on cap

The `compactOnCap` setting (off by default) compacts the conversation when the ping budget runs out, while the cache is still warm. It compacts only when the compaction's cost plus re-caching the summary is less than re-caching the whole context. The mod records the cost and summary size of each compaction it runs and uses them for the next decision. Compaction loses context detail, which is why it is off by default.

A background notification that arrives during compaction waits until compaction finishes, then starts its turn as usual.

Compaction keeps the earlier messages in the session file. After each compaction it runs, the mod adds a line to the transcript with a command that opens the conversation as it was before that compaction, as a new session. The compacted session does not change. The command needs `jq` and uses `--resume-session-at`, a CLI flag that `claude --help` does not show. `/rewind` cannot go back past a compaction after the session is resumed.

## model-select

The Agent tool's `model` field takes only the aliases `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku` and `fable`. This mod lets a subagent run on any model your account can use, such as `claude-mythos-5-1` or `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.

When the first line of an Agent call's prompt is `model: <model>`, the mod runs the subagent on that model and removes the line before the subagent sees the prompt. The line takes the same names as `/model`: a full model ID, or an alias such as `best` or `opus[1m]`. The mod passes the name on unchanged. A name that does not exist fails at the API with `model_not_found`.

At session start the mod gets the list of models your credential can use from `GET /v1/models`, and the Agent tool's description lists those IDs. The fetch sends no message, so it costs no tokens.

### Limitations

The list needs a first-party Anthropic credential. On Bedrock, Vertex or a gateway, or when the fetch fails, the mod writes one line to the transcript with the reason, and the description lists no IDs. The `model:` line still works. A fork always runs on the parent's model, so the mod refuses a fork that has a `model:` line. `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE` overrides the `model:` line.
